# Cat-and-Mouse
----
# Description
* C# project for school where there is a ball (mouse) that the user is attempting to click on with their computer mouse (cat).
* The game keeps track of the number of times the user succeeded in clicking on the ball and after each try the ball (mouse) speeds up and is harder to catch.
* When the user has clicked 10 times the game ends
* The main purpose was to attempt to capture user input through the form of a mouse click and to test my knowledge on animation speed by having the ball speed up after each click.
